Knowledge of Distillation of Random Forests

The main aim of this paper is to study the distillation of random forest algorithm. Like any other machine learning model random froest also has its own pros and cons. To overcome these cons many researchers have been studying the distillation approach which is our main goal here, To study the performance of algorithm by applying the distilled knowledge. Here, we have taken three datasets from the UCI repository to conduct our study.
